THIS IS THE DEBUG VERSION. IT IS NOT TO BE FLOWN ON ANY VEHICLE.

This version does everything that the flight-ready version does, but also
parses the data and displays it to the user via Serial. This version requires more
clocks cycles and as a result runs much slower than the original. As such, it is not
sufficient to fly on the rocket.
